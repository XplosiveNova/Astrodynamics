#Class: Astrodynamics I

The mission is to design an apse-line rotation maneuver via a 2-Burn Hohmann Transfer Burn. The first burn in the intial orbit to maneuver the satellite,  and a correction burn to place it into the final orbit. Initial and Final Orbital Data is given, and the objective is to find the optimal True Anomoly and delta-V for initiating an ideal Hohmann Transfer.
