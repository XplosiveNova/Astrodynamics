# Astrodynamics

This is a repository of all my Astrodynamics, GNC, &amp; Flight Performance Software packages used for a variety of projects across my aerospace engineering classes. This repository includes:

 - Optimized Non-Planar Hohmann Transfer across Earth
 - TSTO Launch Sequence then transfer to GEO orbit*
 - Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem Transfer from Earth to Moon and towards all Lagrange Points with Delta-V Optimization*
 - 10-Body Problem Trajectory Simulation of Earth to Jupiter Satellite Transfer with Delta-V Optimization*
 - 15-Body Problem Trajectory Simulation of Earth to Pluto Satellite Transfer with Delta-V Optimization*
 - Reverse Engineered F-15E Aircraft Takeoff, Cruise-Climb, and Cruise Scenarios
 - Optimization Process of a supercritical airfoil section.

*A majority of the source code was created by Dr. Julio Cesar Benavides at UT Arlington Â© 2025 and is notated as such. These programs and concepts were explained and derived in-class however and do not reflect a gap in understanding of ode45, bvp4c, etc.

*However, the mission architecture was designed and created by me using learned knowledge of astrodynamics & GNC.
