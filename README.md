# Portfolio Summary

This is a repository of all my Astrodynamics, GNC, &amp; Flight Performance MATLAB Code packages used for a variety of projects across my aerospace engineering classes. The overall focus of this portfolio is to highlight the work I've done in MATLAB throughout my academic career and the skills - whether job-specific or general MATLAB knowledge - I've learned that can apply to industry. It is still WIP as more projects get configured to GitHub.

This repository includes:

 - Optimized Delta-V Apse Line Rotation Simulation
 - Optimized Non-Planar Hohmann Transfer across Earth
 - TSTO Launch Sequence then transfer to GEO orbit*
 - Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem Transfer from Earth to Moon and towards all Lagrange Points with Delta-V Optimization*
 - 10-Body Problem Trajectory Simulation of Earth to Jupiter Satellite Transfer with Delta-V Optimization*
 - 15-Body Problem Trajectory Simulation of Earth to Pluto Satellite Transfer with Delta-V Optimization*
 - Reverse Engineered F-15E Aircraft Takeoff, Cruise-Climb, and Cruise Scenarios
 - Optimization Process of a supercritical airfoil section.

*A majority of the source code for astrodynamics projects was created by Dr. Julio César Benavides © UT Arlington 2025 and is notated where necessary. These programs and concepts were explained and derived in-class however and do not reflect a gap in understanding of ode45, bvp4c, etc. The mission architecture was designed and created by me using learned knowledge of astrodynamics & GNC.
