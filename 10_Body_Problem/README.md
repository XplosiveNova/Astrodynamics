# Class: Astrodynamics II

This Project is a simulation of a satellite being launched from LEO into a multi-planetary mission to Jupiter where it is then parked 30 Jupiter Radii away, taking into account the effect of gravity from: Earth, Moon, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Io, Callisto, Europa, and Ganymede.

The program is split within three different segments A through C in order. Program A calculates and plots a porkchop plot of all possible trajectories since the launch window of January 1, 2031 using Time Dependent Lambert's Problem approach. An optimal Delta-V is then calculated which can be used as an input into Program B, which calculates a preliminary trajectory of the satellite using ODE45 integration. The rough data is then refined into Program C as a final trajectory of the satellite is calculated via BVP4C integration. Note that this program runs best with parallel processing.

The optimal delta-v of the mission was calculated to be 6.3 km/s with an elapsed mission time of ~ 808 JD's or 2.2 years.
