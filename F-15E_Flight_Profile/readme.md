# Class: Flight Performance, Stability, and Control

This MATLAB package includes multiple different sets of programs over aerodynamic simulations of the American F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft. Software includes in-order:

 - A simple, accurate atmospheric model of the Earth as a function of altitude
 - Geometric Reverse Engineering of the A/C through webplotdigitizer.com
 - Calculating/Estimating the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic aerodynamic properties of the A/C including Lift and Drag
 - Parametric analysis of the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine for the aircraft
 - Simulation of the A/C during Cruise-Climb conditions at constant Lift and Velocity
 - Simulation during Climb Conditions at constant EAS and throttle

This code extensively used ODE45 as a numerical integrator to find the position, velocity, angle of attack, and aerodynamic forces across a trajectory profile. All code was created personally with the guidance of Dr. Ian Maynard as projects throughout the class.
