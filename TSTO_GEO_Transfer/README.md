# Class: Astrodynamics II

This Project is a simulation of a satellite being launched via a Falcon 9 Block V launch vehicle to LEO, stay in orbit until it's able to complete a non-planar hohmann trasnfer, transfer to a target vehicle's orbit, complete a phazing maneuver to size the orbit to the target's position, then propagate said orbit for 24 hours.

The total delta-v of the mission was calculated to be XX km/s with a total mission time of XX JD's.
